# LockBox

A password manager built in C that allows users to store and retrieve their passwords to a txt file, *for now*. Users can add, retrieve, and remove password entries.

### To-Do

- ~~Divide the code into header files, logic and main.~~
- Get rid of the logins.txt file because it's a security shit show.
- Implement some stronger encryption.
- Implement pointers and linked list.
- Figure out a way to deploy / release the console app.
